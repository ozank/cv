abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. So far these harmonics are mainly identified using spectral estimation techniques. However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

abstract = {The study in this paper investigates whether the air gap harmonics can be identified by using an external search coil placed on the frame of an induction motor. For this purpose the study focuses on the prediction of rotor speed of an induction motor from external search coil emf, using spectral analysis techniques. In the first stage of the study the type of search coil which maximizes the induced emf is sought, also the position of the coil on the induced emf is investigated. Several motors are tested with a sinusoidal supply as well as a PWM inverter power supply and the search coil voltage is sampled. FFT analysis of the recorded data is performed in Matlab environment. An algorithm is developed for identifying the rotor speed using the FFT analysis results. It is shown that the developed algorithm is capable of predicting the motor speed under various load conditions and motor speeds. The speed estimation accuracy of this approach is also discussed. In short, this paper illustrates that the induced emf in an external search coil contains information on air gap harmonics, and these harmonics can be identified even when the motors are supplied with a PWM inverter.},

abstract = {In industrial drives market, speed and position estimation is one of the most important subjects for accurate motor drives. Vector controlled drives has the best dynamic performance among AC motor drives. Sensorless vector control is one of the most studied one. However, sensorless drive systems fail at low or zero speeds and may not have enough accuracy. For better accuracy and speed range speed sensors or position encoders are usually essential. However, coupling of sensor and sensor prices introduces extra cost on the drive. Thus in order to reduce the cost of the drive a cheap and easy to mount speed sensors is essential. Throughout out this study, a speed and position sensor using an external search coil placed between cooling fins on the frame of an induction machine is proposed. The search coil utilizes the fringing flux outside the frame of induction motor. Using the induced voltage on the external search coil, a new method that estimates the flux and rotor position is proposed. In this study, the induced voltage on the search coils are investigated with different types of search coils placed on various positions. And the frequency domain and time domain analysis are performed in order to build a model that can estimate machine flux, rotor speed and rotor position. As a result of this study, a low cost, easy to mount speed and position sensor is designed and implemented. Experiment results are presented.},

Ancak bu y\"{o}ntemde \"{o}rnek alınması ve hesaplama, mili saniye mertebesinde s\"{u}rmekte ve ger\c{c}ek zamanda uygulanması vekt\"{o}r kontrollu sistemler a\c{c}ısından herhangi bir fayda sağlamamaktadır. Burada sunulan yaklaşımda ise rotor oluk harmoniklerini i\c{c}eren sinyal ger\c{c}ek zamanda işlenebilmekte ve sonu\c{c} mikro saniyeler i\c{c}erisinde alınabilmektedir. Y\"{o}ntemin \"{o}z\"{u} motordan elde edilen sinyalin; besleme gerilimi frekansında bir gerilim \"{u}zerine bindirilmiş olarak rotor oluk harmoniklerini i\c{c}eren bir başka sinyalin varlığının farkına varılmış olmasıdır. Bu durumda rotor oluk harmoniklerini ayıklamak basit bir demod\"{u}lasyon işlemine d\"{o}n\"{u}şmektedir. Bildiri g\"{o}zlemin arkasında yatan teoriyi a\c{c}ıkladıktan sonra, demod\"{u}lasyon işleminin nasıl yapılacağını g\"{o}stermektedir. \"{O}ne s\"{u}r\"{u}len yaklaşım bir deney ortamında uygulanarak yaklaşımın ge\c{c}erliliği g\"{o}sterilmiştir. Bu yaklaşımla rotor olukları bir encoder gibi kullanılarak ger\c{c}ek zamanda sens\"{o}rs\"{u}z olarak rotor konumu veya hızı elde edilebilmektedir. Bu nedenle de sens\"{o}rs\"{u}z s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}lerin performansının sens\"{o}rl\"{u} s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}ler kadar iyi olması imkanı doğmaktadır.},

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

abstract = {Air-gap flux of all electrical machines contains harmonics. Some of these harmonics stem from rotor slotting of the machine. These harmonics can be utilized for control or diagnostic purposes. In the literature, rotor slot harmonics are mostly utilized for condition monitoring. There is also some research utilizing them for rotor speed estimation. However, it is observed that in the existing work spectral analysis techniques are employed which require long samples of data and in this from they are not suitable for vector control of induction motors. Accurate position information is vital for high performance vector control of induction motors. Furthermore using a sensor which requires some kind of modification on the motor is not desirable. A novel method has been proposed in this study that does not need any spectral estimation techniques. In this approach extracting the required information can be done within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. Furthermore, any modification of the motor is not necessary. In this paper the proposed approach is presented. Experimental results illustrate that the position prediction accuracy of the approach is very high.},
