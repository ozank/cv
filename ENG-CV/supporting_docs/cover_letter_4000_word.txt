I am currently a RA in the IES in the School of Engineering at Edinburgh. My research is focused on renewable energy applications. Since 2009, based on this research I have published 6 journal papers, 15 referred conference papers (2 of which won best paper/poster award), and have filed one patent. My research has been recognised through invited presentations at the Royal Society of Physics and UK Magnetics Society, as well as invited contributions to two books published by Woodhead Pub. and the IET.

Since my first contract in 2009, I have worked in many research projects with companies such as NGenTec, Hayward Tyler, NAREC, RenewNet, Aquamarine Power, MCT, AWS. Furthermore, I have led IES' contribution, as well as acting as the main researcher, to a work-package in a 3 year EU FP7 Project, which has 17 partners. I believe I gained enough experience and contacts from these projects to apply for research grants and lead projects. IES has extensive testing facilities in wave and tidal (e.g. FloWave TT), but lacks the matching capabilities for research on electrical side. If I get the position, I will work to close that gap, which can make it possible IES to offer complete wire-to-resource research solutions. At the moment, I am now working in an open-source design tools and knowledge base project for wind and marine energy, which I believe will strengthen UoE's position as a main research hub in the renewable energy sector.

In addition to my consultancy work, I have been involved in cutting-edge research in my PhD on superconducting(SC) generators, which is a topic considered to to take-off in the next decade. I designed a novel generator topology that surpasses all the existing superconducting machine designs in terms of modularity, reliability and significant cost benefits by utilising only 10% of the SC tape compared to other designs. Although, I am the first researcher in IES working on SC machines, my project has strengthened the links between Edinburgh and GE Energy-Power Conversion, leading to transfer of a superconducting lab to UoE, which includes a helium cryocooler and a huge vacuum chamber that can be used by other institutes within UoE. There are many research opportunities in this area which I would like to contribute with my research experience. SC transmission lines and fault current limiters can be excellent applications for future HVDC systems, which is one of the IES' strategic research areas. I am also planning to work on SC magnetic gearboxes, which will have worldâ€™s first with unmatched torque density capabilities.

Since I got BSc degree in 2005, I have been teaching in different courses. I was a research and teaching assistant in METU, which is the highest-ranked university in Turkey, for four years. I tutored in 3rd year and 4th year undergraduate machines and power electronics courses. I was the laboratory coordinator and main point of contact for over 200 students. In UoE, I supervised 2nd year Power Engineering and 3rd year Power Generation Labs and gave lectures on IDCORE programme in the last two years. I am confident and passionate on teaching and e-learning and I can take responsibility on power electronics, power systems and machines courses as supervising. I supervised 2 MEng and 2 MSc students, one of them developed a condition monitoring app that is downloaded more than 500 times. I am also an active advocate of e-learning and online teaching, I have set-up a wiki page within the IES research group and I am the owner of a research tips blog, which has more than 2000 visitors per day.

In summary, I have experience with industrial partners as well as leading the superconducting research, and EUFP7 project. I have presented in invited talks and given lectures, took initiative within the research group, which strengthen my communication and presentation skills. I believe my experience in research and ambition in teaching has the potential to make significant contribution to the University of Edinburgh.
