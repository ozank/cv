\section{Major Research Interests}

\subsection{Research Impact \& Achievements}
My research output has resulted in high research impact in terms of consultancies and knowledge exchange activities. Within last five years, I published seven journal papers (one included in RAE), two invited book contributions, 11 refereed conference papers (two won the best paper/poster award) and filed one patent. 

The superconducting machine design I developed in my PhD project resulted in three invited talks from Institute of Physics, UK Magnetics Society and Superconducting for Energy. Also I got the Young Researcher Award for my work in EUCAS and ICSM conferences. Furthermore, the prototype I developed improved the links between University of Edinburgh (UoE) and General Electric Energy and Power Conversion and led to transfer of an extensive superconducting lab to UoE. 

I worked with different renewable companies across UK, which helped to develop network between industry and university. I worked as the main researcher in an EU FP7 project work package, which brought £320k to UoE. 
%I represented UoE in general project assemblies and work package meetings.

%I designed several machines and power take-off systems varying from 5 kW to 5 MW, all in forms of consultancies and research partnerships, bringing research grants to IES. The details of these works are provided in the next section.

\subsection{Research Interests}

My main area of interest is in the design and development of electrical machines and power electronics. In particular, I am working on novel machine topologies such as superconducting machines and direct-drive permanent-magnet machines, including linear generators. I also worked in reliability assessment and control systems of renewable energy devices.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Superconducting Machines}: I designed a novel generator topology that surpasses all the existing superconducting machine designs in terms of modularity, reliability and significant cost benefits by utilising only 10\% of the SC tape compared to other designs. The topology has chance to be implemented as the world's first superconducting wind turbine. There are many research opportunities in this area that I can contribute with my research experience. SC transmission lines and fault current limiters can be excellent applications for future HVDC systems. I am also planning to work on SC magnetic gearboxes, which will be the world’s first with unmatched torque density capabilities.

\item \textbf{Direct-Drive Permanent Magnet Generators}: I have been working in this area since 2009. I developed design and optimization tools for C-Gen generator, which was the main idea behind NGenTec (a spin-out company from IES). UoE has licensed my design tools  to NGenTec, and they have been used in other consultancy projects. I designed 25 kW and 1 MW generators, both of them are manufactured and tested successfully. I designed a 50 kW linear generator for the Carbon Trust Project, which led to best paper award in ICEM-2010 and 20 citations.

\item \textbf{Power Electronics and Electric Machine Drives}: I completed my Masters on control of AC motors. I developed a novel method that led to an international patent, two journal papers and many conference papers. I am currently involved in a project on HVDC subsea transmission system with NAREC. The concept reduces the number of power electronic components,and hence the overall cost. I am also involved in control of electric machines in the MARINA project, in which I compared different power aggregation techniques for combined wind and wave energy systems.

\item \textbf{Reliability and Condition Monitoring}: The reliability for renewable energy systems are critical, hence almost all the projects I have involved has reliability as the main concept. I believe there is much work to do to cope with harsh operating conditions of renewable energy devices. My PhD topic introduced a fault-tolerant, modular generator topology, which can minimise down-times in a wind turbine. I have also analysed the failure modes of combined wind and wave energy plaftorms for the MARINA Project. One of my MSc students developed an electric machine fault-detection app for smart phones, which has been downloaded 500 times less than in six months.

\section{Research Experience \& Projects}
\begin{longtable}{lp{3cm}p{12cm}}
2014 & NAREC & Design of next generation HVDC network for the offshore renewable energy industry. I am desigining a high-frequency high-power transformer that can be coupled to the HVDC transmission line. The proposed system has fewer power electronics and cost advantages over existing AC and DC systems. (WP Budget:£30k)\\
2011--2014 & EU FP7 Project &  MARINA Platform Project is a 3 year EU FP7 project with 17 industrial and academic partners, which aims to design combined wave and wind energy platforms. I was the main researcher in WP7, and I have led and presented UoE in work package meetings and general assemblies, which helped me to have contacts across Europe and build my presentation skills. I developed a design tool for sizing and efficiency calculation for wind and wave power take-off systems and the tools was shared with the research community as an open source tool. (WP~Budget:£300k)\\
2013 & United Arab Emirates Uni. & Design of a 5 kW permanent-magnet linear generator test rig.\\
2013 & General Electric & A project to validate the superconducting generator topology that I developed during my PhD. General Electric agreed to loan the superconducting coil, vacuum chamber and other test equipments to UoE for the cryogenic experiments.\\
