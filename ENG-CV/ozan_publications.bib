abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. So far these harmonics are mainly identified using spectral estimation techniques. However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

In order to reduce torque ripple and make their dynamic performance better, various parameters of two different rotary VCM topologies are studied with finite element analysis. The effects of magnet separation angle, coil separation angle and coil type on torque characteristics are analyzed. In order to achieve better dynamic performance and higher precision, optimization study is conducted to find optimum design, which has only 3.3{\%} torque ripple throughout its whole operation range.},

In this study, a test rig which is composed of a DC motor, an AC synchronous generator and an external flywheel, is developed in order to provide a platform in which dynamic properties of an actual power plant can be simulated in the laboratory conditions. A 4 kVA power plant simulator with a field exciter and a speed governor is developed with 1kVA buck converters. The frequency response of the test bench is controlled in parallel with the computer simulations in Digsilent Powerfactory environment. The developed test rig is a low cost and simple solution aimed for experimental studies regarding inertial support of renewable energy systems or power system frequency studies.},

abstract = {Air-gap flux of all electrical machines contains harmonics. Some of these harmonics stem from rotor slotting of the machine. These harmonics can be utilized for control or diagnostic purposes. In the literature, rotor slot harmonics are mostly utilized for condition monitoring. There is also some research utilizing them for rotor speed estimation. However, it is observed that in the existing work spectral analysis techniques are employed which require long samples of data and in this from they are not suitable for vector control of induction motors. Accurate position information is vital for high performance vector control of induction motors. Furthermore using a sensor which requires some kind of modification on the motor is not desirable. A novel method has been proposed in this study that does not need any spectral estimation techniques. In this approach extracting the required information can be done within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. Furthermore, any modification of the motor is not necessary. In this paper the proposed approach is presented. Experimental results illustrate that the position prediction accuracy of the approach is very high.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. These harmonics may supply valuable information for condition monitoring of bearings, windings or rotor bars. Utilization of these harmonics for rotor speed and position estimation is limited mainly due to long sampling periods required by spectral estimation techniques. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method is proposed that does not need any kind of spectral estimation. In this approach extracting the required information can be done within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {A novel Vernier type magnetically geared direct-drive generator for large wind turbines is introduced in this paper.

In this paper, an electrically excited (PM{\_}less) claw-pole type Vernier machine is presented. This new topology has the potential of reducing mass and cost of the generator, and can make the construction easy in manufacturing and handling. Analytical designs are verified using 3D finite-element simulations and several designs are evaluated to find the optimum design for a 7.5 MW, 12 rpm wind turbine application. It is shown, that the required torque can be achieved with an outer diameter of 7.5 m, and with a mass of 172 t (including the structural mass). The proposed generator is compared with commercial direct-drive generators, and it is found that the proposed generator has the highest torque density with 34.7 kNm/t.},

abstract = {This thesis describes four novel superconducting machine concepts, in the pursuit of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated electrical sheets, the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, it is much easier to replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on- site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6.6 m and an axial length of 1.4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market.},

abstract = {The study in this paper investigates whether the air gap harmonics can be identified by using an external search coil placed on the frame of an induction motor. For this purpose the study focuses on the prediction of rotor speed of an induction motor from external search coil emf, using spectral analysis techniques. In the first stage of the study the type of search coil which maximizes the induced emf is sought, also the position of the coil on the induced emf is investigated. Several motors are tested with a sinusoidal supply as well as a PWM inverter power supply and the search coil voltage is sampled. FFT analysis of the recorded data is performed in Matlab environment. An algorithm is developed for identifying the rotor speed using the FFT analysis results. It is shown that the developed algorithm is capable of predicting the motor speed under various load conditions and motor speeds. The speed estimation accuracy of this approach is also discussed. In short, this paper illustrates that the induced emf in an external search coil contains information on air gap harmonics, and these harmonics can be identified even when the motors are supplied with a PWM inverter.},

abstract = {In industrial drives market, speed and position estimation is one of the most important subjects for accurate motor drives. Vector controlled drives has the best dynamic performance among AC motor drives. Sensorless vector control is one of the most studied one. However, sensorless drive systems fail at low or zero speeds and may not have enough accuracy. For better accuracy and speed range speed sensors or position encoders are usually essential. However, coupling of sensor and sensor prices introduces extra cost on the drive. Thus in order to reduce the cost of the drive a cheap and easy to mount speed sensors is essential. Throughout out this study, a speed and position sensor using an external search coil placed between cooling fins on the frame of an induction machine is proposed. The search coil utilizes the fringing flux outside the frame of induction motor. Using the induced voltage on the external search coil, a new method that estimates the flux and rotor position is proposed. In this study, the induced voltage on the search coils are investigated with different types of search coils placed on various positions. And the frequency domain and time domain analysis are performed in order to build a model that can estimate machine flux, rotor speed and rotor position. As a result of this study, a low cost, easy to mount speed and position sensor is designed and implemented. Experiment results are presented.},

Eddy current dampers are more advantageous compared to conventional mechanical dampers as they are maintenance-free due to contactless structure and have higher reliability, which is very desirable in aerospace applications. An initial eddy current brake prototype is manufactured and the test results are used to verify the 3-D finite element simulations. The effect of temperature on the brake performance is investigated. Finally, a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization is applied to find the optimum pole number and geometric dimensions of the eddy current brake in order to achieve the desired torque-speed characteristic while the total weight of the brake is minimized.

abstract = {Superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the tower head mass for large (∼10MW) offshore wind turbines. However, a high temperature superconductor generator should be as reliable as conventional generators for successful entry into the market. Most of the proposed designs use the superconducting synchronous generator concept, which has a higher cost than conventional generators and suffers from reliability issues. In this paper, a novel claw pole type of superconducting machine is presented. The design has a stationary superconducting field winding, which simplifies the design and increases the reliability. The machine can be operated in independent modules; thus even if one of the sections fails, the rest can operate until the next planned maintenance. Another advantage of the design is the very low superconducting wire requirement; a 10MW, 10 rpm design is presented which uses 13 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. The outer diameter of the machine is 6.63m and it weighs 184 tonnes including the structural mass. The design is thought to be a good candidate for entering the renewable energy market, with},
