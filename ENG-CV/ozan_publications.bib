abstract = {The drive for larger offshore turbines with greater outputs is curtailed by the physical size of the generator and the ability to install devices in remote areas with often changeable weather conditions. High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) machines offer the technology able to replace large Direct Drive Permanent Magnet (DDPM) generators with more compact machines. However some theoretical HTS designs often neglect the practicality of the physical support structure required to tolerate the huge magnetic attraction forces produced by increased field flux. Offshore wind turbines require structurally robust machines with low operation and maintenance costs as well as lightweight, material efficient designs. This paper will investigate a generator structure for a proposed HTC electrical machinedesign.},

abstract = {Although electromagnetic launchers (EMLs) are superior to classical gun-powder-based launchers, they have to withstand extreme electrical and mechanical conditions. Therefore, the optimal design and precise simulations of these devices are crucial. In this article, a new simulation strategy for EMLs is proposed in order to achieve high accuracy and reduced complexity. The inductance and electromotive force (EMF) variations in the transient, which have a considerable influence on the launch process, are modeled using the finite element method (FEM) coupled with electrical circuit simulation. The proposed method has a good agreement with the experimental results of two EMLs (EMFY-1 and EMFY-2), which have 25- and 50-mm square bores and 3-m-length launchers. The study showed that the hybrid model with transient inductance and EMF calculations showed a good agreement with experiments that have 625 kJ-3.241-MJ input energies.},

abstract = {Although axial-flux permanent magnet machines have high torque densities, challenges regarding mass production of stators make them a less appealing choice. Printed circuit board (PCB) axial-flux machine is a type of machine with a stator that is made of layers of PCB. Given the precise, fast, and cheap mass production capabilities of PCB manufacturers, PCB axial-flux machines stand as a viable alternative for conventional round-wire winding machines. In this study, five different winding topologies are compared. Their induced phase voltages and torque are calculated using the developed magnetic scalar potential method and finite element analysis (FEA). Proposed windings are tested on a 16-pole, 2000-RPM, double rotor-single stator axial-flux permanent magnet synchronous machine. Results showed that the parallel winding had the smallest resistance and loss. Moreover, radial and concentric winding had the highest induced voltage and torque while the radial winding had 20% less phase resistance than concentric. Also, the induced voltage of radial winding had the smallest total harmonic distortion in comparison with other winding types. A novel unequal width parallel winding is proposed and it is compared with parallel winding separately. It is found that by simply increasing the cross-section area of wave windings, it is possible to decrease copper loss by 17%.},

One megawatt direct-drive axial flux permanent magnet generator is presented. The novelty in this design is that instead of conventional stranded wires, the windings of the generator are manufactured from a conductor sheet by cutting and bending processes. This creates critical advantages of superior current ratings, ease of manufacturing, and reduced structural mass. An optimization study is conducted with the presented fully analytical model, and the optimum design is compared with the other wind power generators presented in the literature.

In parallel connected common DC bus systems, current unbalance is a major issue that results in thermal stresses and over current or voltages. In this paper, two different new current balancing methods are proposed: Cross-coupled Rx modules and intentional de-tuning of Rx side resonant frequency. These methods are investigated both analytically and experimentally for a single Tx and two Rx system for a 500 W prototype. The proposed methods are tested independently, and then the combined current balancing method is also investigated. For the same misalignment case, cross-coupled/de-tuned has a 55.8% current balancing improvement compared to de-coupled/fully-tuned topology.},

abstract = {Nonlinearities in voltage source inverters (VSIs) such as; dead time, switching time, delay time, voltage drops on the power switches, parasitic capacitance, etc., are considered to be the main sources of the output voltage distortions. These distortions result in low-order harmonics in the output current, which in turn increase core losses and create torque ripples. In particular, for low-speed applications with low-inductance motors, the control performance and the stability of the system degrades substantially, especially when the system operates in the low-torque region. In this work, the effects of these nonlinearities on the phase current and on the current control of the silicon (Si) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) based VSI are investigated with an air cored low inductance permanent magnet synchronous motor. Furthermore, Gallium nitride (GaN) enhancement mode high electron mobility transistor (E-HEMT) based VSI is proposed to overcome this problem. Next, improvements in the current control process are demonstrated by comparing the experimental results obtained by using GaN E-HEMT and Si MOSFET based VSIs. Results show that GaN E-HEMT based VSI is a better choice for applications, which require a high bandwidth control.},

In particular, in the low speed and low torque applications the control performance and the stability of the system degrades substantially. Although as the switching frequency increases the effects of the dead time, the switching time and the delay time become more notable, to achieve a high current control bandwidth higher switching frequency is required. High performance VSI-fed motor drive can be realized both by reducing the effects of the VSI nonlinearities and by having a high current control bandwidth. In this work, GaN transistor based VSI-fed permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive is used to achieve a high current control bandwidth. Since the current loop is the inner most loop of the control loop, it enables the outer speed and position loops to be faster. This high performance servo motor drive can be used in applications such as control of pedestals, robot arms, optic stabilizers, CNC machines, active vibration cancellers etc. that require high control bandwidths.},

@inproceedings{Alemdar2019a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 IEEE. Gallium Nitride Enhancement-Mode High Electron Mobility Transistors (GaN HEMTs) are superior to other power transistors in terms of efficiency, package size and switching speed which leads to increased power density in power converter applications. However, GaN HEMTs have much shorter short-circuit withstand time compared to the conventional devices, which is limited to several hundred nanoseconds. Therefore, reliable and fast protection solutions are required to protect GaN HEMTs from fatal over-current failures. In this paper, a novel short-circuit (SC) protection scheme based on fault current sensing by using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout parasitics is proposed. The proposed scheme uses the voltage drop on the parasitic inductance of the PCB trace to detect very intense high slew rate SC faults. In addition, the voltage drop on the parasitic resistance of the PCB trace is utilized to detect relatively slow over-current (OC) faults. Once a fault is detected, a soft turn-off mechanism is initiated by the proposed circuit to turnoff devices gradually to eliminate over-voltage breakdown risk. The proposed circuit is verified by both SPICE simulations and hardware implementation. The experimental results show that both SC and OC faults can be detected and GaN HEMTs can be protected. The total operation duration for the circuit is 370 ns during a SC fault. The SC fault can be detected within 30 ns and the soft turn-off mechanism is initiated within 80 ns to terminate the SC current flowing through the GaN HEMTs within 290 ns.},

abstract = {A rail geometry with a convex cross section instead of a rectangular one provides a higher contact area, uniform current density, and less transition on the contact surface, and it increases the performance in electromagnetic launchers. In addition, the design of convex rails should be considered together with armature structure, the distance between rails, rail length, and parasitic masses that all have an influence on the overall efficiency and armature/rail transition. A novel complete rail and launch package optimization method is presented in this article. In the first part of this article, the optimum convex rail cross sections for five different separation values are found to obtain uniform current density distribution on rail cross section. For this part, a transient finite element (FE) model in 2-D is developed to calculate the current density distribution and combined with a real-coded genetic algorithm (GA). Then, the armature and sabot petal masses are calculated for each optimized rail geometry and each separation values. In the second part, the efficiency of each optimum design with different separation values is evaluated by a transient 3-D FE model with transient solver taking the calculated armature and sabot petal masses into account. Finally, the length of the rails of the final design is investigated for the transition phenomena. It is observed that 48-mm rail separation with 12.9-and 21-mm elliptical cross-sectional parameters has the highest exit velocity (2355 m/s) for 400-g projectile with uniform current density at inner rail surfaces.},

abstract = {The utilization of external field windings in electromagnetic launchers provides an additional electromagnetic field between the rails of an electromagnetic launcher which increases the Lorentz force acting on the armature in the acceleration direction. However, additional magnetic field created by the conventional copper windings are very limited due to their low maximum current carrying capability. Therefore, using high temperature superconductors (HTS) with a current carrying capability up to 100 A/mm2 for the external coils can be used to increase the magnetic field density between rails. This paper presents an optimization study for the design of two external coils with rectangular tape YBCO superconducting wire. The HTS coils are proposed to increase the efficiency of a 3 meter long launcher with 25 mm x 20 mm rectangular bore caliber. The optimization parameters are selected as the magnitude of the DC coil current, the coil position, the number of turns of the coil, and the number of coil layers. Also, the objective function of the optimization is the electromagnetic force acting on the armature, which is dependent of the rail current and B field on the armature. During the operation of the launcher and the external coils, it is critical to prevent quenching of the HTS coils due to the perpendicular and tangential magnetic field on the coils, temperature and current density of the coils. In order to estimate the quench and calculate the objective function, finite element analysis (FEA) is used in 2D. Real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) is also used as optimization method. The results of the optimization study shows that HTS coil augmentation is feasible for small caliber railguns. The HTS coil position is limited by cryogenic chamber and rail containment dimensions. The maximum coil current is determined by the self field due to cancellation B field generated by the rails and the coils. For 500 kA rail current the force acting on the armature increases from 55 kN to 70 kN with and increase rate of 26%, a muzzle velocity increase from 1650 m/s to 1900 m/s with an increase rate of 12% and a muzzle energy increase from 160 kJ to 210 kJ with and increase rate of 25% when external HTS coil augmentation is used.},

In this paper, the comparison of inductive XRAM generator and capacitor-based (C-based) generator topologies is discussed for the excitation of an electromagnetic launcher (EML). In addition, the effect of capacitance or inductance of the storage element on the load current and laucher efficiency is investigated. The circuit simulation results of these PPS topologies are presented, each of which having 200 kJ PPS energy. The EML used in the study has 0.1 kg total mass of projectile, 3 m long rail. Although the energy density of the XRAM generators is larger than C-based PPSs, the design of an XRAM generator is more challenging than C-based PPS due to the large voltage drop of its opening switches. Moreover, the efficiency of the total system is highly dependent on the design of the storage element. For the XRAM generator, the efficiency is limited by the capability of the opening switches. In this study, using RC snubber circuit, the voltage stress on the GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor opening switches of the XRAM generator is decreased to 2 kV peak voltage, which is available in the market.},

abstract = {There are two possible strategies for wind power plants (WPPs) and solar power plants (SPPs) to maximize their income in day ahead markets (DAM) in the presence of imbalance cost: joint bidding (JB) via collaboration by participating to balancing groups and deployment of storage technologies. There are limited studies in the literature covering the comparative analysis of “JB strategy” with “battery deployment (BD) strategy”. In the existence of balancing responsibility, the comparative analysis of these strategies is the main contribution of this study to the literature. Our Second contribution is the analysis of the impact of different regulatory regimes, which are set by the regulatory authority, on total income. JBM (joint bidding model), which is the model for joint bidding via different collaboration groups, is developed for the analysis of JB strategy, BDM (battery deployment model), which is the model covering the deployment of storage technology, is developed for the analysis of BD strategy. The impact of each strategy on total income is analyzed. According to the analysis of the results of the models, while JB strategy, which is sensitive to the regulatory regime, increases the total annual income of the collaboration groups up to 0.65%, BD strategy seems not feasible and financially viable. On the other hand, extra income values per MW of battery for SPP is between $218 and $400 /MW-year, while these values are between $2460 and $6795/MW-year for the group of 15 WPPs. Therefore, deployment of battery for WPPs creates extra income more than tenfold of that of SPP. BD strategy can be viable provided that the levelized cost of deployment of battery drops below the extra income values achieved per MW of battery.},

An electric grid having high impedance seen from the connection point is considered as a weak grid and it adversely affects the system stability of grid-tied voltage source inverters in renewable power devices. In this study, an adaptive controller is proposed by configuring the settling time of the phase-locked loop based on the estimated grid impedance. Pseudorandom binary sequence injection and Fourier techniques are carried out for grid impedance estimation. Impedance-based stability analysis is performed for a predetermined steady-state operation point. The proposed method is verified by a 300-kVA inverter prototype for wide-range grid impedance varying from 0.3 to 3 mH.},

abstract = {In this study, an experimental approach for the weighting factor design of the predictive torque control of an induction motor (IM) is presented. The weighting factor is set to the value which yields a low total harmonic distortion (THD) figure in the phase currents. Then, this optimized value is dynamically adjusted with respect to the speed error term, which is defined as the magnitude of difference between the commanded speed and the actual speed. By doing so, superior transient performance is achieved without sacrificing steady-state THD values. The presented approach for dynamically adjusted weighting factor is tested on a two-pole, 500 W IM, driven by a two-level voltage source inverter (2L-VSI), via finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method: by the adoption of dynamic lambda approach, speed reversal time from -3000 rpm to +3000 rpm is decreased by 38% under the same controller structure and settings.},

The main motivation is to show the engineers and researchers a way of simple, fast and low cost experimentation on MPC. By using an off the shelf motor drive development platform and modifying the existing macros and libraries for motor control, the implementation time and difficulty can be reduced considerably.

abstract = {There are trade-offs for each power converter design which are mainly dictated by the switching component and passive component ratings. Recent power electronic devices such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors can improve the application range of power converter topologies with lower conduction and switching losses. These new capabilities brought by the GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) inevitably changes the feasible operation ranges of power converters. This paper investigates the feasibility of Buck and Boost based bi-directional DC/DC converter which utilizes Quasi-Square-Wave (QSW) Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) on GaN HEMTs. The proposed converter applies a high-switching frequency at high output power to maximize the power density at the cost of high current ripple with high frequency of operation which requires a design strategy for the passive components. An inductor design methodology is performed to operate at 28 APP with a switching frequency of 450 kHz. In order to minimize the high ripple current stress on the output capacitors an interleaving is performed. Finally, the proposed bi-directional converter is operated at 5.4 kW with 5.24 kW/L or 85.9 W/in3 volumetric power density with air-forced cooling. The converter performance is verified for buck and boost modes and full load efficiencies are recorded as 97.7% and 98.7%, respectively.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel and non-invasive stator inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) online detection method is presented for an induction machine (IM), driven by a two-level voltage source inverter (2L-VSI) via finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). The main idea of the proposed method is to utilize the controller itself as an observer: under the presence of a fault, the distribution of inverter switching states significantly deviates from the original balanced case. Therefore, by inspecting the inverter switching vectors, which are the outcomes of the FCS-MPC routine's online optimization procedure, a stator fault can be detected efficiently. It is observed that both the zero-vector allocation over the complex plane and the allocation among the active vectors are influenced by the presence of a stator short-circuit fault. The proposed fault detection strategy introduces little to no extra burden for processor and memory. Experimental results verify the proposed method, and inter-turn short circuits of two and three turns are confidently detected and located for a 500 W, two-pole IM.},

A model is constructed using a cost optimized 2.5 MW Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator and it is simulated by using finite element method (FEM). The feasibility of the topology and the controllability range determined by the dominance of the excitation types are discussed.

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

abstract = {The study in this paper investigates whether the air gap harmonics can be identified by using an external search coil placed on the frame of an induction motor. For this purpose the study focuses on the prediction of rotor speed of an induction motor from external search coil emf, using spectral analysis techniques. In the first stage of the study the type of search coil which maximizes the induced emf is sought, also the position of the coil on the induced emf is investigated. Several motors are tested with a sinusoidal supply as well as a PWM inverter power supply and the search coil voltage is sampled. FFT analysis of the recorded data is performed in Matlab environment. An algorithm is developed for identifying the rotor speed using the FFT analysis results. It is shown that the developed algorithm is capable of predicting the motor speed under various load conditions and motor speeds. The speed estimation accuracy of this approach is also discussed. In short, this paper illustrates that the induced emf in an external search coil contains information on air gap harmonics, and these harmonics can be identified even when the motors are supplied with a PWM inverter.},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

However, sensorless drive systems fail at low or zero speeds and may not have enough accuracy. For better accuracy and speed range speed sensors or position encoders are usually essential. However, coupling of sensor and sensor prices introduces extra cost on the drive. Thus in order to reduce the cost of the drive a cheap and easy to mount speed sensors is essential. Throughout out this study, a speed and position sensor using an external search coil placed between cooling fins on the frame of an induction machine is proposed. The search coil utilizes the fringing flux outside the frame of induction motor. Using the induced voltage on the external search coil, a new method that estimates the flux and rotor position is proposed. In this study, the induced voltage on the search coils are investigated with different types of search coils placed on various positions. And the frequency domain and time domain analysis are performed in order to build a model that can estimate machine flux, rotor speed and rotor position. As a result of this study, a low cost, easy to mount speed and position sensor is designed and implemented. Experiment results are presented.},

abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. So far these harmonics are mainly identified using spectral estimation techniques. However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {This thesis describes four novel superconducting machine concepts, in the pursuit of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated electrical sheets, the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, it is much easier to replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on- site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6.6 m and an axial length of 1.4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market.},

A 4 kVA power plant simulator with a field exciter and a speed governor is developed with 1kVA buck converters.

abstract = {The main aim of this study is to optimize an axial flux eddy current damper to be used in a specific aviation application. Eddy current dampers are more advantageous compared to conventional mechanical dampers as they are maintenance-free due to contactless structure and have higher reliability, which is very desirable in aerospace applications. An initial eddy current brake prototype is manufactured and the test results are used to verify the 3-D finite element simulations. The effect of temperature on the brake performance is investigated. Finally, a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization is applied to find the optimum pole number and geometric dimensions of the eddy current brake in order to achieve the desired torque-speed characteristic while the total weight of the brake is minimized. It is found that the mass and volume of the initial prototype can be halved by implementing this optimization algorithm.},

abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of a direct-drive per- manent magnet generator for a tidal turbine power take-off system, namely MCT's SeaGen –the world's first full scale commercial tidal turbine– has been investigated. The investigated PM generator topology is called C-GEN which is an air-cored axial-flux generator developed in the University of Edinburgh. The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented. I.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

One of the most important features in the barrel side is the shape of the armature. In this study, the shape of the armature is optimized by using independent variables to define the exact geometry of the armature. The main goal is to maximize the muzzle kinetic energy of the projectile. Armature geometry is divided into pieces which are used in the optimization algorithm as independent variables. Finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the fitness function of the genetic algorithm (GA).},

In order to reduce torque ripple and make their dynamic performance better, various parameters of two different rotary VCM topologies are studied with finite element analysis. The effects of magnet separation angle, coil separation angle and coil type on torque characteristics are analyzed. In order to achieve better dynamic performance and higher precision, optimization study is conducted to find optimum design, which has only 3.3% torque ripple throughout its whole operation range.},
